//This Variable bellow are called in funcion add

/*Reduce can call a array and manipuled him with a variale receving value from function in initial arra 0 when add are called
*/
//A function can acess Variable "outside" from the fuction like 'numbers'
// And in this function add are declared outsied in const and after that are used here
// Two new 'variables' are declared when the function start and the magic happen right?
function add(accumulator, a) {
    // Function add receive 2 arguments and return the sum
  return accumulator + a; // returning the sum from acmullator and a
}
// in the Final the result are a Array numbers Mofified by a logic up here /\
console.log(numbers); // 278
