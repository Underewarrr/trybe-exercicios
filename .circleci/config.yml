# This config is equivalent to both the '.circleci/extended/orb-free.yml' and the base '.circleci/config.yml'
version: 2.1

# Orbs are reusable packages of CircleCI configuration that you may share across projects, enabling you to create encapsulated, parameterized commands, jobs, and executors that can be used across multiple projects.
# See: https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/orb-intro/
orbs:
  node: circleci/node@4.7
  vulnerability-checker: whitesource/vulnerability-checker@19.10.1
# Invoke jobs via workflows
# See: https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/configuration-reference/#workflows
workflows:
  sample: # This is the name of the workflow, feel free to change it to better match your workflow.
    # Inside the workflow, you define the jobs you want to run.
    jobs:
      - vulnerability-checker/scan:
           directory: . 
      - node/test:
          # This is the node version to use for the `cimg/node` tag
          # Relevant tags can be found on the CircleCI Developer Hub
          # https://circleci.com/developer/images/image/cimg/node

# Use the latest 2.1 version of CircleCI pipeline process engine.

version: 2.1

orbs:
  # The Node.js orb contains a set of prepackaged CircleCI configuration you can utilize
  # Orbs reduce the amount of configuration required for common tasks.
  # See the orb documentation here: https://circleci.com/developer/orbs/orb/circleci/node
  node: circleci/node@4.7

jobs:
  # Below is the definition of your job to build and test your app, you can rename and customize it as you want.
  build-and-test:
    # These next lines define a Docker executor: https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/executor-types/
    # You can specify an image from Dockerhub or use one of our Convenience Images from CircleCI's Developer Hub.
    # A list of available CircleCI Docker Convenience Images are available here: https://circleci.com/developer/images/image/cimg/node
    docker:
      - image: cimg/node:16.10
    # Then run your tests!
    # CircleCI will report the results back to your VCS provider.
    steps:
      # Checkout the code as the first step.
      - checkout
      # Next, the node orb's install-packages step will install the dependencies from a package.json.
      # The orb install-packages step will also automatically cache them for faster future runs.
      - node/install-packages:
          # If you are using yarn, change the line below from "npm" to "yarn"
          pkg-manager: npm
      - run:
          name: Run tests
          command: npm test

workflows:
  # Below is the definition of your workflow.
  # Inside the workflow, you provide the jobs you want to run, e.g this workflow runs the build-and-test job above.
  # CircleCI will run this workflow on every commit.
  # For more details on extending your workflow, see the configuration docs: https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/configuration-reference/#workflows
  sample:
    jobs:
      - build-and-test
      # For running simple node tests, you could optionally use the node/test job from the orb to replicate and replace the job above in fewer lines.
      # - node/test
